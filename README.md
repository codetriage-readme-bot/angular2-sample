# Angular2 Sample

The sample codes are based on a seriese of my blog entries, please see the [wiki pages](https://github.com/hantsy/angular2-sample/wiki) for more details.

Make sure you have installed the latest NodeJS and NPM.

Run the following command to and run the project.

```
npm run start

```

It requires a backend server to serve the APIs, I mentioned in [Interact with backend APIs](https://github.com/hantsy/angular2-sample/wiki/3-http).
